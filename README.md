MDCS:FM Process-Mining project work

# 🚀 Process Mining project work with Jupyter Notebook  

Welcome to this project! This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** for process analysis, leveraging **process mining techniques, data exploration, and machine learning**.  

## 📁 Project Structure  
- 📂 data/ # Contains all relevant datasets
- 📄 main.ipynb # Main Jupyter Notebook for analysis

The **main Jupyter Notebook** (`main.ipynb`) guides you through the analysis but **does not contain all the detailed reports**. If you need the full report, please **contact me via email**.  

## 🏗️ Steps in the Analysis  

1. **📥 Import and Libraries**  
   - Load essential Python libraries for data analysis and processing.  

2. **📊 Data Understanding**  
   - Explore dataset structure, data types, and summary statistics.  

3. **⏳ Evolution of System States Over Time**  
   - Analyze how system states evolve over time.  

4. **🧹 Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.  

5. **🔎 Process Discovery**  
   - Apply **Process Mining** techniques to derive a **Petri Net**, a graphical representation of business process flows.  

6. **🤖 LLM as a Process Expert Intermediate**  
   - Utilize **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to interpret and enhance the process insights.
